# Hi, I'm Paul Frederiksen 👋

**Global AWS Partner Technical Leader @ Splunk | Cloud Security & Strategic Partnerships | Film Photographer**

Based in Las Vegas, NV

## About Me

I build high-trust technology partnerships that deliver customer outcomes at the intersection of security, cloud, and go-to-market. With a hands-on technical background and strong empathy for builders and operators, I translate technical needs into scalable partner motions and co-built solutions.

Currently leading the technical alliance between Splunk and AWS, I've spent years at the forefront of cloud security, DevOps, and strategic partnerships—having worked at AWS in various solutions architect roles, LaunchDarkly, and leading engineering teams at POLITICO, Videology, and beyond.

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions or building partnerships, I'm behind the camera shooting film photography, capturing desert landscapes and urban scenes. Follow my work on [Instagram @iamdesertpaul](https://instagram.com/iamdesertpaul).
